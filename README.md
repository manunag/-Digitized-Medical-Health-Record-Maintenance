Despite many innovations in information technology, there is no application to
store medical records, People often tend to lose or miss their medical records.
Sometimes, they forget to take those records with them when they visit hospital.
To solve all these problems, an application is developed in this project to store
available health records of patients such as X-Rays, MRI, CT scans etc.
securely at one place. This mobile application helps to access patientâ€™s medical
details from anywhere in the world with just having an internet connection. The
user have to first register himself/herself using username, password and email
id. User will have permissions to upload and view the records according to the
type of the medical record.
